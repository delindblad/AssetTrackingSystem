## Team members
Only me.

## Notes
Serialization to .json of abstract classes seems to be unsupported. I have therefor not used polymorphism for the "Asset" type. I have however used it in other parts of the application related to the interface.

## Future improvements
Support for removing and modifying assets. Automatic purge after a certain amount of time. Option to mark as broken/missing.
